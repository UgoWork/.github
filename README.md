# .github Repository

This repository contains default community health files for all repositories in the organization. These files help standardize important practices and guidelines across the organization.

## Purpose

The `.github` repository allows us to centralize commonly used files that will automatically apply to all repositories in the organization, unless they have repository-specific files. This ensures consistency and helps teams follow organizational best practices.

## Files Included

### 1. **ISSUE_TEMPLATE/** 
Templates for creating issues (e.g., bug-report, feature-request, etc.). These templates ensure that issues are well-structured and contain necessary information.

### 2. **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md**
A template that provides a standard format for pull request descriptions, helping to make PR reviews more efficient.

## Usage

These files are automatically used by any repository in this organization unless overridden by repository-specific files. This helps keep organizational practices consistent and ensures that all repositories have baseline documentation in place.
